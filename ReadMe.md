# Requirements
1. Familiarize more with **LangChain** and implementing a simple **RAG chatbot**, based off of a RealPython tutorial found [here](https://realpython.com/build-llm-rag-chatbot-with-langchain/).
2. Customize to add additional functionality, like choosing which LLM to use (including running local LLMs with Ollama).
3. Add options of using different embeddings models as well.
4. Add functionality for RAG relevant to other domains / check personal notes for one of many ideas to implement.
